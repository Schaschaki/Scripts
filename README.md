#Scripts

I revised the whole code and tried to match your directions.
Also I added some functionality and a lot of failsaves.

Idea: I could create a singular task to bring the character in a position from where the other tasks can operate, because currently I'm checking for every possible breaking situiation in every task and some of the problems overlap between Tasks, so that would probably be a good idea to slim down the code and make it more readable.
